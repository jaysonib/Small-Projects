//hii friends . welcome to our you tube channel "Programming Knowledge"
//here is the program for make directory and remove directory
//First we create a directory name "programming_knowledge"
//which is at location C://turboc3//capture ..
//and then we will see how to remove directory.
//and then we will see all the files in currnet directory(where the program is saved)







//so let's start
//we have required these header files
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <process.h>
#include <dir.h>

void main()
{
clrscr();

int a;
//we have to create another name directory beacause we have already make it "program"
//program is removed and program1 is created now we remove mkdir step it will remove program1 directory

//now we see how to remove it
//now we check all directory where program is saved

//it is saved in bin directory
system("dir/p");
getch();

}
